### COMP20 Repository for Joe Kamibeppu

1. The purpose of this Git repository is to allow version control with my COMP20 assignments and labs, as well as showcase my progress during this course.

2. Assignment 2 and 3 were my favorite assignments. Coming into COMP20, the "client" and the "server" were two abstract concepts that I had a hard time understanding. The two assignments helped me understand the precise roles of the client and the server. The client-server relationship is now crystal clear!

3. COMP20 allows students to learn about many technologies over one semester. Coming into the course, I did not have any experience in web programming at all. COMP20 gave me an overview of web development, and taught me about its many components and their relationships.

4. Version control and JSON. First, I learned how essential version control is for individual and group programming projects. I cannot imagine approaching any more programming work without Git - it is a crucial coding companion that I didn't know I needed. Second, JSON reminded me of something I first learned in COMP40: a message only holds power when its sender and receiver agree on its meaning. During COMP20, we saw many examples of why JSON is a powerful message (data) format. It eliminates a need to create different data formats at various stages of web development. In assignment 3, we saw that JSON can be maintained in MongoDB, transported from a server to a client via an HTTP request, and finally parsed and used at its destination. The data is never touched or reformatted during the trip, because everyone has already agreed on the format - this is very powerful.

5. As an IR and Computer Science major, I am interested in web and computer security from both the policy and technical perspectives. I am excited to take COMP116 next semester!
