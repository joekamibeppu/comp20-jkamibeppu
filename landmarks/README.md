### Assignment 2: Historic Landmarks

1. All aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly. The web page retrieves my location and uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send my information. In addition, the page correctly parses the JSON response file to retrieve information about classmates and nearby historic landmarks. Finally, the web page correctly calculates the closest landmark to where I currently am.

2. I discussed high-level ideas on this assignment with classmates Yuta Okada and Anna Kasagawa. 

The index.html and style.css files were adopted from an example by Professor Ming Chow.

3. I spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment.
