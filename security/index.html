<h1> Security Assessment of Heroku Server </h1>

<p> Joe Kamibeppu <br> April 19, 2016 <br> COMP20 Spring 2016 </p>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> The objective of this assignment is to identify and resolve security issues in the client-side and server-side coursework implemented by my partner, Brendan Fahey. COMP20 assignments 2 and 3 asked students to complete client-side and server-side applications, respectively. Both assignments disregarded security or error handling, leaving much room for security and privacy vulnerabilities. My client's two products in question are outlined below.</p>

<p> Assignment 2 - Historic Landmarks </p>
<ol>
	<li> Retrieve the application user's current location using the geolocation API. Calculates the closest historic landmark to the user.</li>
	<li> Retrieve and displays the locations of COMP20 students and nearby historic landmarks using the JSON and Google Maps API. </li>
	<li> Utilize the XMLHttpRequest object. </li>
</ol>

<p> Assignment 3 - Server for Historic Landmarks </p>
<ol>
	<li> Serve the Historic Landmarks application using Heroku, Node.js and Express.</li>
	<li> Provide information on recent checkins and return JSON data on past checkins.</li>
	<li> Utilize a MongoDB database and JSON APIs.</li>
</ol>

<p> As a security consultant, my role is not only to challenge my client's work to expose vulnerabilities - I will also make security and privacy recommendations to improve my client's web application.</p>

<h2> Methodology </h2>

<p> I first performed black box testing - I attacked my client's web application without reading the source code. Using curl, I attempted to add untrusted data to the web application such as image files, Javascript, links to other sites.</p>

<p> Next, I reviewed my client's source code. </p>

<h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>

<h2> Security Issues Found </h2>

<h3> Issue 1: Cross Origin Resource Sharing </h3>

<ul>
	<li> The GET and POST APIs in the Heroku server 
</ul>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
